All nodes should be able to handle multiple requests simultaneously. You may achieve this using threads. You may also use other means to achieve this goal

Asynchronous Handling with FastAPI and Async I/O
Concurrency in FastAPI: Since FastAPI uses asynchronous I/O by default, async functions can serve multiple requests at the same time without blocking. For example, each async endpoint (e.g., publish_message, create_topic) can be processed in parallel by FastAPIâ€™s event loop.
httpx.AsyncClient: Since httpx.AsyncClient is also asynchronous, it allows for non-blocking requests to other nodes, which improves responsiveness even when nodes need to forward requests.



The peer node must be able to host topics while it is simultaneously interacting with other topics.

Yes, the setup you currently have with FastAPI and asynchronous handling allows a peer node to host topics and interact with other topics simultaneously. Here's how this setup addresses the requirement:

Asynchronous Endpoints:

The API endpoints (like create_topic, delete_topic, publish_message, etc.) are defined with async def, meaning FastAPI will process each request independently in a non-blocking way.
This non-blocking, asynchronous handling allows the node to manage multiple incoming requests at the same time without waiting for one request to complete before starting another.
Concurrent Request Handling:

For example, if one request is made to create a topic, while another request comes in to publish a message to a different topic, the node can handle both requests concurrently.
This concurrent handling ensures that hosting a topic (i.e., creating it, managing it, or updating it) does not interfere with other operations or topics.
Parallel Processing for Multiple Topics:

The asynchronous request handling allows the node to create, delete, publish to, and pull from multiple topics simultaneously. FastAPI, backed by httpx.AsyncClient, supports this by processing each API call in a way that doesn't block other requests.
